Hi there! I'm Linus the Lizard, the fastest little guy in this park. I was sunbathing on my favorite rock when I spotted a group of kids setting up a picnic. The cupcakes-they were so shiny! I thought to myself, "Linus, you deserve a closer look."

Carl the Cat was skulking nearby, acting like he owned the place. I could tell he had his eyes on the sandwiches. Then Sam the Sloth appeared. Can you believe he wanted to join the fun? He's so slow he probably thought the picnic was going to last all day!

I swear I didn't touch anything. I was just inspecting the cupcakes when suddenly, Carl pounced toward the sandwiches! Out of nowhere, a dog came charging in, barking like crazy. The kids screamed, and the picnic was ruined. It's a shame-I bet those cupcakes tasted amazing. But between you and me, I think Carl knocked everything over on purpose.
