Oh, hey there. I'm Sam the Sloth. I'm not the fastest, but I sure do enjoy the little things in life. Last Thursday, I saw a group of kids having a picnic under my favorite tree. It looked so niceâ€”sandwiches, cupcakes, even juice boxes. I figured I'd mosey over and say hi.

Carl the Cat was there, looking all sneaky like he always does. Linus the Lizard was darting around the blanket, acting like he couldn't decide where to go. I think he might've been after the cupcakes.

I had just reached the edge of the blanket when everything went wild. A dog came charging in, barking so loud it startled me! Carl jumped, Linus disappeared, and the picnic turned into a mess. I think the kids left because of the dog, but Carl insists it wasn't his fault. Honestly, I was just trying to enjoy the shade.
