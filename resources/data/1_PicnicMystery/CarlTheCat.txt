Hello, I'm Carl the Cat. I'm the cleverest cat in the neighborhood, and I spend my days prowling around, looking for adventure. Last Thursday was a particularly sunny day, so I decided to wander near the park. That's when I saw it-the most mouthwatering pile of sandwiches and cupcakes, all laid out neatly on a checkered picnic blanket.

I wasn't the only one who noticed. Linus the Lizard was there too, darting about like he had some secret lizardy business. I caught him eyeing the cupcakes. Then there was Sam the Sloth, moving toward the blanket at his usual snail's pace.

As I was about to make my move toward the sandwiches, a loud bark startled me. A dog came running, and everything turned into chaos. The sandwiches were overturned, the cupcakes scattered, and the kids who owned the picnic screamed and ran away. I blame Linus-he's always up to something shady.
