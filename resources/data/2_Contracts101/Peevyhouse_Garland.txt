Peevyhouse v Garland Coal & Mining Co (1962) â€“ Efficient Breach and Damages
This case, decided by the Oklahoma Supreme Court, highlights the tension between the expectation of contractual performance and the economic principle of efficient breach. Willie and Lucille Peevyhouse owned a farm containing coal deposits. They entered into a lease agreement with Garland Coal & Mining Co., which allowed the company to conduct strip mining on the property. The agreement stipulated that Garland would restore the land after mining operations were completed. Garland breached the contract by failing to perform the agreed-upon restoration. The Peevyhouses sought damages for the cost of restoring their land, which was estimated at $29,000, far exceeding the $300 by which the restoration would have increased the property's value.

The court awarded only $300 in damages, reasoning that the cost of performance was disproportionately high relative to the economic benefit. The court emphasized that damages should be measured by the diminished value of the property, not the cost of performance, unless the performance was the central purpose of the contract. This case has been criticized for undermining the sanctity of contract performance, but it also illustrates the principle of efficient breach, where breaching the contract and paying damages may be economically preferable to full performance. It remains a pivotal case in the study of damages and the balance between contractual rights and economic efficiency.
