Lucy v Zehmer (1954) – Intent to Contract
This case from the Supreme Court of Virginia underscores the importance of objective intent in determining the validity of a contract. The dispute centered around a purported agreement to sell a farm. On a social evening, W.O. Zehmer and his wife, after consuming alcohol, wrote and signed a document that appeared to convey the sale of their farm to A.H. Lucy for $50,000. Lucy considered the agreement binding, while Zehmer argued it was made in jest and never intended to be a serious offer. Zehmer maintained that the discussion was a joke meant to humor Lucy, and that he had no real intention of selling the property.

The court, however, held that the validity of a contract is determined by the outward manifestation of intent, rather than the unexpressed mental state of the parties. The written and signed agreement, along with the detailed terms, indicated a serious intent to contract from an objective standpoint. The court ruled in favor of Lucy, enforcing the contract despite Zehmer’s subjective claim that he was joking. This case remains a vital precedent in illustrating that contract formation depends on the reasonable interpretation of words and actions, rather than the private thoughts of the parties involved.
