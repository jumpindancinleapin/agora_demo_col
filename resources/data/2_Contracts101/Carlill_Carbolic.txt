Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co (1893) – Offer and Acceptance
This seminal case is a cornerstone of contract law, illustrating the enforceability of unilateral contracts. The dispute arose when the Carbolic Smoke Ball Company, in an attempt to promote their medicinal product during a flu epidemic, published an advertisement offering a reward of £100 to any person who contracted influenza after using their smoke ball as directed. The company claimed to have deposited £1,000 in a bank to demonstrate their sincerity. Louisa Carlill purchased and used the product according to the instructions but later contracted influenza. She sought to claim the promised reward.

The company argued that the advertisement was mere "puffery" and not a binding offer, asserting that no formal acceptance of the offer had occurred, and the promise lacked consideration. However, the court rejected these arguments. It held that the advertisement constituted a unilateral offer, which could be accepted by performing the stipulated conditions (i.e., using the product as directed). The deposit of £1,000 demonstrated the company’s intent to create legal relations, and Carlill's actions constituted acceptance and consideration. The court clarified that notification of acceptance in unilateral contracts is not required unless explicitly stated in the offer. This case remains a foundational authority on the principles of offer, acceptance, and intent to create legal relations.
